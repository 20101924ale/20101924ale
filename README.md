## Hello! I'm Alexandra
(she/her)
I am currently completing my course in Computer Forensics & Security at SETU Waterford. While my primary passion lies in cybersecurity, Iâ€™m also deeply interested in law and legal principles, particularly in how they intersect with technology.

Additionally, I enjoy creating engaging software designs and exploring UX principles to better understand user behavior and enhance digital experiences.
